# Reporting a Vulnerability

**If you've found a security vulnerability, please report it to cinnyapp@gmail.com since Foxtanium nor Hostnetwork have resources to patch issues and its best if the creators do the patching since they know the code better then we, if you have something related directly to editions made by our modification(which is doubt) report it to matrix@hostnetwork.xyz!**
